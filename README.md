Project Description

This project is about using KMeans Clustering to Cluster Customer Tweets for a Telecommunications Company. It can also be said to be topic modelling. Topic modelling is a method for finding a group of words (i.e. topics) from a collection of documents that best represents the information in the collection of text documents. It can also be thought of as a form of text mining - a way to obtain recurring patterns of words in textual data. The topics identified are crucial data points in helping the business figure out where to put their efforts in improving their product or services.

In this project I use unsupervised technique - Kmeans, to cluster/ group reviews to identify main topics/ ideas in the sea of text. This can be applicable to any textual reviews. In this project I will focus on twitter data which is more real world and more complex data. Topic modelling provides us with methods to organize, understand and summarize large collections of textual information. It helps in:

Discovering hidden topical patterns that are present across the collection
Annotating documents according to these topics
Using these annotations to organize, search and summarize texts
among others
